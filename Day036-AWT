Java AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit) is an API to develop Graphical User Interface (GUI) or windows-based applications in Java.

Java AWT components are platform-dependent i.e. components are displayed according to the view of operating system.
AWT is heavy weight i.e. its components are using the resources of underlying operating system (OS).

The java.awt package provides classes for AWT API such as TextField, Label, TextArea, RadioButton, CheckBox, Choice, List etc.

The AWT tutorial will help the user to understand Java GUI programming in simple and easy steps.

Java AWT calls the native platform calls the native platform (operating systems) subroutine for creating API components like TextField, ChechBox, button, etc.
For example, an AWT GUI with components like TextField, label and button will have different look and feel for the different platforms like Windows, MAC OS, and Unix.
The reason for this is the platforms have different view for their native components and AWT directly calls the native subroutine that creates those components
