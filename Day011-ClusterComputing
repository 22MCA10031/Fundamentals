Cluster computing is a collection of tightly or loosely connected computers that work together so that they act as a single entity. 
The connected computers execute operations all together thus creating the idea of a single system. 
The clusters are generally connected through fast local area networks (LANs)

1. Cluster computing gives a relatively inexpensive, unconventional to the large server or mainframe computer solutions.
2. It resolves the demand for content criticality and process services in a faster way.
3. Many organizations and IT companies are implementing cluster computing to augment their scalability, availability, processing speed and resource management at economic 
   prices.
4. It ensures that computational power is always available.
5. It provides a single general strategy for the implementation and application of parallel high-performance systems independent of certain hardware vendors and their 
   product decisions.
