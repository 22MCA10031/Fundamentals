Hacking in cyber security refers to the misuse of devices like computers, smartphones, tablets, and networks to cause damage to or corrupt systems, gather information on 
users, steal data and documents, or disrupt data-related activity.

A traditional view of hackers is a lone rogue programmer who is highly skilled in coding and modifying computer software and hardware systems. But this narrow view does
not cover the true technical nature of hacking.

Hackers are increasingly growing in sophistication, using stealthy attack methods designed to go completely unnoticed by
cybersecurity software and IT teams. 

They are also highly skilled in creating attack vectors that trick users into opening malicious attachments or links and freely 
giving up their sensitive personal data.

As a result, modern-day hacking involves far more than just an angry kid in their bedroom. It is a multibillion-dollar industry with extremely sophisticated and 
successful techniques.
