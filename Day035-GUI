A GUI (graphical user interface) is a system of interactive visual components for computer software. 
A GUI displays objects that convey information, and represent actions that can be taken by the user. 
The objects change color, size, or visibility when the user interacts with them.

The GUI was first developed at Xerox PARC by Alan Kay, Douglas Engelbart, and a group of other researchers in 1981. 
Later, Apple introduced the Lisa computer with a GUI on January 19, 1983.

A GUI includes GUI objects, like icons, cursors, and buttons. 
These graphical elements are sometimes enhanced with sounds, or visual effects like transparency and drop shadows.
Using these objects, a user can use the computer without having to know commands.
