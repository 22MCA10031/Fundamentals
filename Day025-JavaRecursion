The process in which a function calls itself directly or indirectly is called recursion and the corresponding function is called as recursive function. 
Using recursive algorithm, certain problems can be solved quite easily.

Examples of such problems are Towers of Hanoi (TOH), Inorder/Preorder/Postorder Tree Traversals, DFS of Graph, etc. 

What is base condition in recursion? In the recursive program, the solution to the base case is provided and the solution of the bigger problem is expressed in terms of 
smaller problems.
