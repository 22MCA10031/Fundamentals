In Java, the program contains classes and methods. 
Further, the methods contain the expressions and statements required to perform a specific operation. 
These statements and expressions are made up of tokens. In other words, we can say that the expression and statement is a set of tokens. 
The tokens are the small building blocks of a Java program that are meaningful to the Java compiler. 
Further, these two components contain variables, constants, and operators

The Java compiler breaks the line of code into text (words) is called Java tokens. 
These are the smallest element of the Java program. 
The Java compiler identified these words as tokens. 
These tokens are separated by the delimiters. 
It is useful for compilers to detect errors. 
Remember that the delimiters are not part of the Java tokens.
