Read-only memory (ROM) is a critical component in most computerized devices that's often responsible for allowing devices to boot up and maintain consistent information 
when unplugged. Understanding this type of memory is often required for many people who work in IT or a similar field that uses computers. 
Learning about ROM and its workings in various practical fields can help you improve your qualifications to advance your career.

ROM is a type of computer memory that typically remains unchanged once you install it onto an electronic device, but some types of ROM allow for alteration. 
The information stored in a ROM memory chip remains unchanged when the electronic device powers off, making it a form of nonvolatile memory that permanently stores data 
on a computer.

Users can't change this information on a computer, which often contributes to static functions, such as booting the device or providing instructions to run other devices,
such as a printer. This memory uses binary code to store itself in the computer's system, and it doesn't require electricity to save its data.
