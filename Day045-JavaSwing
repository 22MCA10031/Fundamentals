Java Swing tutorial is a part of Java Foundation Classes (JFC) that is used to create window-based applications. It is built on the top of AWT (Abstract Windowing Toolkit) API and entirely written in java.
Unlike AWT, Java Swing provides platform-independent and lightweight components.
The javax.swing package provides classes for java swing API such as JButton, JTextField, JTextArea, JRadioButton, JCheckbox, JMenu, JColorChooser etc.

Java Swing Examples:
There are two ways to create a frame:
1. By creating the object of Frame class (association)
2. By extending Frame class (inheritance)

We can write the code of swing inside the main(), constructor or any other method.
