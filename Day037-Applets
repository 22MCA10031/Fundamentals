An applet is a program written in the Java programming language that can be included in an HTML page, much in the same way an image is included in a page.
When you use a Java technology-enabled browser to view a page that contains an applet, the applet's code is transferred to your system and executed by the browser's Java
Virtual Machine (JVM).

Every version of the Java Software Development Kit (aka JDK) includes a set of demo Applets which includes source code.
