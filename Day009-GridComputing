Grid Computing can be defined as a network of computers working together to perform a task that would rather be difficult for a single machine. 
All machines on that network work under the same protocol to act as a virtual supercomputer. 
The task that they work on may include analyzing huge datasets or simulating situations that require high computing power. 
Computers on the network contribute resources like processing power and storage capacity to the network.

Advantages of Grid Computing: 
1. It is not centralized, as there are no servers required, except the control node which is just used for controlling and not for processing.
2. Multiple heterogeneous machines i.e. machines with different Operating Systems can use a single grid computing network.
3. Tasks can be performed parallelly across various physical locations and the users donâ€™t have to pay for them (with money).

Disadvantages of Grid Computing:
1. The software of the grid is still in the involution stage.
2. A super fast interconnect between computer resources is the need of hour.
3. Licensing across many servers may make it prohibitive for some applications.
4. Many groups are reluctant with sharing resources .
