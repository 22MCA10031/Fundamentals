The this keyword refers to the current object in a method or constructor.

The most common use of the this keyword is to eliminate the confusion between class attributes and parameters with the same name (because a class attribute is shadowed by
a method or constructor parameter). If you omit the keyword in the example above, the output would be "0" instead of "5".

this can also be used to:
1. Invoke current class constructor
2. Invoke current class method
3. Return the current class object
4. Pass an argument in the method call
5. Pass an argument in the constructor call
