Polymorphism means "many forms", and it occurs when we have many classes that are related to each other by inheritance.
Like we specified in the previous chapter; Inheritance lets us inherit attributes and methods from another class. 
Polymorphism uses those methods to perform different tasks. This allows us to perform a single action in different ways.
There are two types of polymorphism in Java: compile-time polymorphism and runtime polymorphism. We can perform polymorphism in java by method overloading and method
overriding.
If you overload a static method in Java, it is the example of compile time polymorphism. Here, we will focus on runtime polymorphism in java.
