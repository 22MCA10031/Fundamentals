Personal computer (PC), a digital computer designed for use by only one person at a time. 

A typical personal computer assemblage consists of a central processing unit (CPU), which contains the computerâ€™s arithmetic, logic, and control circuitry on an 
integrated circuit; two types of computer memory, main memory, such as digital random-access memory (RAM), and auxiliary memory, such as magnetic hard disks and special 
optical compact discs, or read-only memory (ROM) discs (CD-ROMs and DVD-ROMs); and various peripheral devices, including a display screen, keyboard and mouse, and printer.

Since the early 1990s, Microsoft operating systems and Intel hardware dominated much of the personal computer market, first with MS-DOS and then with Windows.
Alternatives to Microsoft's Windows operating systems occupy a minority share of the industry. 
These include Apple's macOS and free and open-source Unix-like operating systems, such as Linux. 
The advent of personal computers and the concurrent Digital Revolution have significantly affected the lives of people in all countries.
