Time-sharing, in data processing, method of operation in which multiple users with different programs interact nearly simultaneously with the central processing unit(CPU) 
of a large-scale digital computer.

Because the CPU operates substantially faster than most peripheral equipment (e.g., video display terminals and printers), it has sufficient time to solve several 
discrete problems during the input/output process. 

Even though the CPU addresses the problem of each user in sequence, access to and retrieval from the time-sharingsystem seems instantaneous from the standpoint of remote 
terminals since the solutions are available to them the moment the problem is completely entered.
