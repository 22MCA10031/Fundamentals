Semaphores are integer variables that are used to solve the critical section problem by using two atomic operations, wait and signal that are used for process 
synchronization.

Types of Semaphores:
There are two main types of semaphores i.e. Counting semaphores and Binary semaphores. Details about these are given as follows âˆ’

Counting Semaphores-
These are integer value semaphores and have an unrestricted value domain. 
These semaphores are used to coordinate the resource access, where the semaphore count is the number of available resources. 
If the resources are added, semaphore count automatically incremented and if the resources are removed, the count is decremented.

Binary Semaphores-
The binary semaphores are like counting semaphores but their value is restricted to 0 and 1. 
The wait operation only works when the semaphore is 1 and the signal operation succeeds when semaphore is 0. 
It is sometimes easier to implement binary semaphores than counting semaphores.
