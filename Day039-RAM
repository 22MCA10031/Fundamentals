Computer random access memory (RAM) is one of the most important components in determining your system’s performance. RAM gives applications a place to store and access 
data on a short-term basis. It stores the information your computer is actively using so that it can be accessed quickly. 

The more programs your system is running, the more you’ll need. SSDs (solid state drives) are also important components and will help your system reach its peak 
performance.

The speed and performance of your system directly correlate to the amount of RAM you have installed. If your system has too little RAM, it can be slow and sluggish.
But on the opposite end, you can install too much with little to no added benefit. There are ways to see if your computer needs more memory, and to make sure you are 
buying memory that is compatible with the other components in your system. Generally, components are created to the highest standard at the time of manufacture, but with
the expectation that technology will continue to change.
