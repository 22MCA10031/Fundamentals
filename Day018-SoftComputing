Soft computing is an approach where we compute solutions to the existing complex problems, where output results are imprecise or fuzzy in nature, one of the most 
important features of soft computing is it should be adaptive so that any change in environment does not affect the present process. 
The following are the characteristics of soft computing.

It does not require any mathematical modeling for solving any given problem
It gives different solutions when we solve a problem of one input from time to time
Uses some biologically inspired methodologies such as genetics, evolution, particles swarming, the human nervous system, etc.
Adaptive in nature.

There are three types of soft computing techniques which include the following:
1. Artificial Neural Network
2. Fuzzy Logic
3. Genetic algorithm
