As networking needs evolved, so did the computer network types that serve those needs. Here are the most common and widely used computer network types:

LAN (local area network): A LAN connects computers over a relatively short distance, allowing them to share data, files, and resources. 
For example, a LAN may connect all the computers in an office building, school, or hospital. Typically, LANs are privately owned and managed.
 
WAN (wide area network): As the name implies, a WAN connects computers over a wide area, such as from region to region or even continent to continent. 
The internet is the largest WAN, connecting billions of computers worldwide. You will typically see collective or distributed ownership models for WAN management.

MAN (metropolitan area network): MANs are typically larger than LANs but smaller than WANs. Cities and government entities typically own and manage MANs.
 
PAN (personal area network): A PAN serves one person. For example, if you have an iPhone and a Mac, it’s very likely you’ve set up a PAN that shares and syncs 
content—text messages, emails, photos, and more—across both devices.
