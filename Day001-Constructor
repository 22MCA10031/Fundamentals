CONSTRUCTOR:-
    A constructor in Java is a special method that is used to initialize objects.
    The constructor is called when an object of a class is created.
    Constructors can also take parameters, which is used to initialize attributes.
    
    Constructors can be divided into 3 types:
         1. No-Arg Constructor.
         2. Parameterized Constructor.
         3. Default Constructor.
