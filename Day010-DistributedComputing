Distributed computing is the method of making multiple computers work together to solve a common problem. 
It makes a computer network appear as a powerful single computer that provides large-scale resources to deal with complex challenges.

For example, distributed computing can encrypt large volumes of data; solve physics and chemical equations with many variables; and render high-quality, three-dimensional 
video animation. 
Distributed systems, distributed programming, and distributed algorithms are some other terms that all refer to distributed computing.
