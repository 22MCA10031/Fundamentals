Database normalization is a technique for creating database tables with suitable columns and keys by decomposing a large table into smaller logical units. 
The process also considers the demands of the environment in which the database resides.

Normalization is an iterative process. Commonly, normalizing a database occurs through a series of tests.
Each subsequent step decomposes tables into more manageable information, making the overall database logical and easier to work with.

Normalization helps a database designer optimally distribute attributes into tables. The technique eliminates the following:

Attributes with multiple values.
Doubled or repeated attributes.
Non-descriptive attributes.
Attributes with redundant information.
Attributes created from other features.
